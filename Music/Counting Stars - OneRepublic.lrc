[00:00.790]Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
[00:05.499]Dreaming about the things that we could be
[00:09.390]But baby I've been I've been praying hard
[00:14.361]Said no more counting dollars
[00:16.362]We'll be counting stars
[00:19.286]Yeah we'll be counting stars
[00:38.59]I see this life like a swinging vine
[00:40.673]Swing my heart across the line
[00:42.585]In my face is flashing signs
[00:44.570]Seek it out and ye' shall find
[00:46.475]Old but I'm not that old
[00:48.511]Young but I'm not that bold
[00:50.434]And I don't think the world is sold
[00:52.540]On just doing what we're told
[00:55.39]I I I I feel something so right
[00:59.233]Doing the wrong thing
[01:02.680]I I I I feel something so wrong
[01:07.32]Doing the right thing
[01:10.459]I couldn't lie couldn't lie couldn't lie
[01:14.200]Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[00:00.790]最近我总是辗转反侧 难以入眠
[00:05.499]对我们曾有过的愿景浮想联翩
[00:09.390]但亲爱的 我早已在内心深处祈祷着
[00:14.361]祈祷自己不再迷失于金钱的追逐中
[00:16.362]我们可以细数满天繁星
[00:19.286]是啊 我们可以细数满天繁星
[00:38.59]生活就像一株跃动的藤蔓
[00:40.673]长驱直入 激活我的内心
[00:42.585]我能感受到太阳的耀眼
[00:44.570]遍寻之后你就会发现
[00:46.475]我虽上了年纪 但也不是老态龙钟
[00:48.511]虽还年轻 却未必鲁莽失礼
[00:50.434]坚信这个世界美好如初
[00:52.540]我只是循规蹈矩地生活着
[00:55.39]惯于离经叛道中
[00:59.233]体味心安理得
[01:02.680]亦于按部就班中
[01:07.32]痛感乏善可陈
[01:10.459]我不可以自欺欺人 不可以自欺欺人
[01:14.200]但置我于死地者 必将赐我以后生
[01:18.166]最近我总是辗转反侧 难以入眠
[01:21.938]对我们曾有过的愿景浮想联翩
[01:25.758]但亲爱的 我早已在内心深处祈祷着

[01:45.567]祈祷自己不再迷失于金钱的追逐中
[01:47.527]我们可以细数满天繁星
[01:56.755]我感觉到爱了 我感觉到它正在燃烧
[01:59.453]于河流的每个迂回处翻腾
[02:01.338]希望只是个四字单词
[02:03.222]身外之物 皆可抛却
[02:05.141]我虽上了年纪 但也不是老态龙钟

[02:17.845]痛感乏善可陈
[02:21.283]我不可以自欺欺人 不可以自欺欺人
[02:25.75]一切淹没我的东西 让我想飞翔
